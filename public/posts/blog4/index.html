Two midterms and three events this week. I am becoming a fizzer whether I like it or not.
Thursday
In the morning I had my class 5 exam which I had booked months before. I got barely any sleep overnight but somehow passed by 1 point!
I then drove to school to catch a mech lecture and my group&rsquo;s lab, where we assembled some hydraulic circuits. I was convinced by the hydro prefix that the fluid would be water, but to my amusement and horror it was oil, and it went everywhere. Horror because I was dressed up for the job fair and any oil stain on my nice shirt would be generational aura debt. Thankfully I was spared from this embarrassment, and although I did end up getting another stain from food, it was hidden by the generously provided nametags.">

<p>In the morning I had my class 5 exam which I had booked months before. I got barely any sleep overnight but somehow passed by 1 point!</p>
<p>I then drove to school to catch a mech lecture and my group&rsquo;s lab, where we assembled some hydraulic circuits. I was convinced by the hydro prefix that the fluid would be water, but to my amusement and horror it was oil, and it went everywhere. Horror because I was dressed up for the job fair and any oil stain on my nice shirt would be generational aura debt. Thankfully I was spared from this embarrassment, and although I did end up getting another stain from food, it was hidden by the generously provided nametags.</p>
<p>At the fair I gave out resumes to every company that was taking them, but none of them really seemed like places I wanted to work at. As headstrong and eager as my cohort is to get hired somewhere, it seems most places just aren&rsquo;t taking summer coops yet.</p>
<p>The EUS was also giving out free food from Breka, and in a moment of weakness I caved in on my most fundamental principles and gorged on all their goodies. I despise the ubiquity of processed junk as a de facto requisite for social events but one time can&rsquo;t hurt. Also in my internet tourism I came across this bit of wisdom that changed my outlook on some things.</p>

<p>There is elegance in the simplicity of these tips. I&rsquo;ve been implementing everything since encountering them and my interpersonal relationships have definitely improved a little.</p>
<p>On the way to the bus loop I saw some raccoons in a tree. It wasn&rsquo;t even that late (7-8 pm) but the sun had set and the campus felt completely deserted, aside from these guys.

<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>Back when Engineers and Geoscientists BC gave me the entrance scholarship in first year I was very grateful and signed up for an account to establish myself as an engineer and geoscientist BC, but thought that was it. A few weeks ago I was surprised to see an email from them inviting me to an event for scholarship winners. I accepted without a second thought.</p>
<p>The meeting was at Steamworks, where I had never been before. I entered with my friend and we were led in through a colossal labyrinth until we arrived at the big special doors at the big special room.</p>
<p>Inside there was plenty of food, which I reluctantly accepted again, and beer, which I have no feud with. I met and spoke to the EGBC board of directors, including a very important guy in TransLink and a guy who had been on CanSat and was starting a space company, so my Orbit membership piqued his interest. This will be a crazy coop opportunity when it comes to fruition, but I need some more down-to-earth experience first. :)</p>

Thanks to my friend for taking this photo. They had an official photographer dude take 100 photos of us from every angle but haven&rsquo;t publicized them yet.</p>
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>I feel tremendously grateful to my lead on Orbit for agreeing to let me skip the meetings occasionally. The rain was torrential, and I needed sleep.</p>
<p>Convincing myself that I had some free time I finally photographed and posted this frog I had folded weeks prior.

<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>
<p>We (this time meaning mentors and mentees) went to laser tag! It was very fun, we had a teams game first and then an FFA.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="images/team.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p><i>A probability cloud of fizzers. I am yet to learn the official plural noun</i></p>
</div>
<p>I played far too tactically, running and crouching more than necessary, and utterly exhausted myself (my quads still hurt). I wasn&rsquo;t the only one though, after the games we went outside and just cooled down for 30 minutes before going back in to our reserved room to feast again. I completely gave up on upholding any sort of boundaries and consumed far too much pizza.</p>
<p>In hindsight that was the first takeout pizza I&rsquo;ve had in at least three years. Wow.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="images/ball.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p><i>Behold the engineering physics intellect on full display.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Since it was apparently some sort of ball appreciation day we also sang happy birthday to ball, even though it was not his birthday. I don&rsquo;t even remember what his username was here.</p>
<p>When our room booking had ended and everyone left, I drove some guys to the skytrain and then eventually got home, far too exhausted to complete my mech problems. I (almost) finished them the next evening.</p>
<p>Tonight was the first evening this week that I could write. This is a big one even without the usual addition of my stream of consciousness, but I pray no week will be this eventful again. See you later.</p>
