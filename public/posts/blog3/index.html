Last week I joined UBC Orbit, a design team that is working on ALEASAT, a satellite equipped with radio and camera capabilities that can take and send pictures of any* location on earth.
*excluding military bases, nuclear silos, alien colonies, etc.
I am making PCBs (printed circuit boards) for the OBC (on board computer). OBC is a very small subteam, and I am the most junior among them, but that just means I get to learn the most.">

<p>Last week I joined <a href="https://www.ubcorbit.com">UBC Orbit</a>, a design team that is working on ALEASAT, a satellite equipped with radio and camera capabilities that can take and send pictures of any* location on earth.</p>
<p>*<sub>excluding military bases, nuclear silos, alien colonies, etc.</sub></p>
<p>I am making PCBs (printed circuit boards) for the OBC (on board computer). OBC is a very small subteam, and I am the most junior among them, but that just means I get to learn the most.</p>
<h2 id="school">School</h2>
<p>First month of school went alright. Classes are a very low priority for me as most lectures are not useful enough to warrant the commute over. Math 400 is the most interesting and useful by a massive margin, but unfortunately also the earliest, which makes it difficult to keep attendance consistent, as sleep takes precedence over grades. Generally I am keeping personal health at the forefront, I hit the weights instead of the books and bike every Sunday. I am also cooking all my meals which is a little time consuming but conserves a lot of other variables as touched on in my last post.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-spirit-of-fairness">In the spirit of fairness&hellip;</h3>
<p>I think that it is bad form to write these entries ahead of the date marked in the title in order to preserve the appearance of an active blog, yet that is exactly what I am doing now. What can I say, it was a rough start to the year, and new habits take months to form. After this one I won&rsquo;t do it anymore. I am getting into the swing of things and thus will be setting aside an hour every weekend to cook these up.</p>
