                Time passes quickly. Macroscopically, we are somehow already a quarter of the way through the century; microscopically, it has been nearly 2 months since my last biweekly blog. Oops.
In my defense, not many weeks are as eventful as the one I wrote about previously. The majority of my waking hours are dedicated to locking in. Thus I have delayed further authorship until a well justified cause …

                Weekly updates have turned out to be difficult as well as unnecessary. Events seem to come in clusters; to paraphrase a well-known quote, there are months where nothing happens, and there are weeks where months happen. This month was the former: mostly midterms, although with one exception.
Halloweek The last week of October was extraordinarily busy, lots of gigantic assignments and little time to …

                 I had two midterms and three events this week, very hectic.
Thursday In the morning I had my class 5 exam which I had booked months before. I got barely any sleep overnight but somehow passed by 1 point!
I then drove to school to catch a mech lecture and my group&rsquo;s lab, where we assembled some hydraulic circuits. I was convinced by the hydro prefix that the fluid would be water, but to my …

                Updates Last week I joined UBC Orbit, a design team that is working on ALEASAT, a satellite equipped with radio and camera capabilities that can take and send pictures of any* location on earth.

                I am now a 3rd year student. For anybody else this would indicate the halfway point of their university experience, but in my program I&rsquo;ll be lucky if it&rsquo;s one third.
Still, time flies. It feels like just yesterday I was building cardboard chairs and claws, and just a day before that I was folding origami in my high school science class. But this makes sense: due to logarithmic time …

                Here is the first real content of my blog. This inaugural post will (briefly) document the assembly of my team&rsquo;s robots for the ENPH253 course.
Our challenge this year was unlike any previous one: we had to build not one, but two fully autonomous robots that could cook, assemble, and serve 3d printed food. There were a variety of recipes, ranging from simple salads to deluxe cheeseburgers. …

                Hello Welcome to my blog. Here is my first post, at least the first that made it out of testing and to deployment.
I will update this blog biweekly occasionally with stories from my life and write about my work on projects.
Thanks to Steven Chen for inspiring me to start this and helping set it up.
My other stuff can be found on my github or gitlab. I prefer the latter as it isn&rsquo;t microsoft …
