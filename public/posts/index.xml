      <description>Weekly updates have turned out to be difficult as well as unnecessary. Events seem to come in clusters; to paraphrase Lenin (without endorsement), there are months where nothing happens, and there are weeks where months happen. This month was the former: mostly midterms, although with one exception.&#xA;Halloweek The last week of October was extraordinarily busy, lots of gigantic assignments and little time to finish them all. I ended up missing one, but did it the following day for practice.</description>

      <description>I had two midterms and three events this week. I am becoming a true fizzer.&#xA;Thursday In the morning I had my class 5 exam which I had booked months before. I got barely any sleep overnight but somehow passed by 1 point!&#xA;I then drove to school to catch a mech lecture and my group&amp;rsquo;s lab, where we assembled some hydraulic circuits. I was convinced by the hydro prefix that the fluid would be water, but to my amusement and horror it was oil, and it went everywhere.</description>

      <description>Updates Last week I joined UBC Orbit, a design team that is working on ALEASAT, a satellite equipped with radio and camera capabilities that can take and send pictures of any* location on earth.&#xA;*excluding military bases, nuclear silos, alien colonies, etc.&#xA;I am making PCBs (printed circuit boards) for the OBC (on board computer). OBC is a very small subteam, and I am the most junior among them, but that just means I get to learn the most.</description>

      <title>2: Starting Third Year</title>

      <description>I am now a 3rd year student. For anybody else this would indicate the halfway point of their university experience, but in my program I&amp;rsquo;ll be lucky if it&amp;rsquo;s one third.&#xA;Still, time flies. It feels like just yesterday I was building cardboard chairs and claws, and just a day before that I was folding origami in my high school science class. But this makes sense: due to logarithmic time perception it feels like we&amp;rsquo;ve lived half our life by age 21.</description>

      <description>Here is the first real content of my blog. This inaugural post will (briefly) document the assembly of my team&amp;rsquo;s robots for the ENPH253 course.&#xA;Our challenge this year was unlike any previous one: we had to build not one, but two fully autonomous robots that could cook, assemble, and serve 3d printed food. There were a variety of recipes, ranging from simple salads to deluxe cheeseburgers.&#xA;Fig. 1. The competition surface.</description>

      <description>Hello Welcome to my blog. Here is my first post, at least the first that made it out of local testing and into deployment.&#xA;I will update this blog biweekly with chronicles of my escapades as well as those less exciting things called projects.&#xA;Thanks to Steven Chen for inspiring me to start this and helping set it up.&#xA;My other stuff can be found on my github or gitlab. I prefer the latter as it isn&amp;rsquo;t microsoft affiliated, but it is trickier to use, as it couldn&amp;rsquo;t deploy this site no matter what I tried.</description>
