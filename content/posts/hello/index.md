# Hello

Welcome to my blog. Here is my first post, at least the first that made it out of  testing and to deployment.

I will update this blog ~biweekly~ occasionally  with stories from my life and write about my work on projects.

Thanks to [Steven Chen](https://shengwen.me/) for inspiring me to start this and helping set it up.

My other stuff can be found on my [github](https://github.com/ron-kit/) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ron-kit/). I prefer the latter as it isn't microsoft affiliated, but it is trickier to use, as it couldn't deploy this site no matter what I tried. Eventually I'd like to move there.

Below I'll test various Hugo and markdown features.
