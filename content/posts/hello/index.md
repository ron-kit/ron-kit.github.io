# Hello
Here is my first post, at least the first that made it out of local testing and into deployment.

I will update this blog weekly with chronicles of my escapades as well as those less exciting things called projects.

Thanks to  [Steven Chen](https://shengw3n.github.io/) for inspiring me to start this and helping set it up.

Below I will test various Hugo and markdown features.
