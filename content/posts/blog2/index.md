I am now a 3rd year student. For anybody else this would indicate the halfway point of their university experience, but in my program I'll be lucky if it's a third.

Still, time flies. It feels like just yesterday I was building cardboard chairs and claws, and just a day before that I was But this makes sense: due to logarithmic time perception you'll feel like you've lived <u>[half your life by age 21](https://suryad.com/blog/percieved-age)</u>. So the fraction of my life I've lived so far is $$\frac{\log 19}{\log 21} \times 0.5 = 48%. $$

## My schedule

I believe these are all 3 credit courses save for the gym.

## Switching to Linux

Computers are a fantastically useful tool, but their utility has a price. In our world convenience comes at the expense of literally everything else. Eating out is not tasty, healthy, or affordable, but it's convenient. Housing near campus is impossible to find, overpriced, and burdensome to maintain once inside, but it's convenient. The preinstalled operating system on any computer is bloated with advertising and spyware but it's convenient. I could go on but you get the point.

I bought my PC about 5 years ago and my laptop 2 years ago, and have been running Windows 10 on them since inception. Since entering university, however, I have grown increasingly frustrated with the limitations and performance offered by it, and begun identifying with a culture that eschews proprietary software in favor of learning how to do stuff yourself. As a first foray into this world I've installed Ubuntu on my laptop. Certainly a long shot from [Terry Davis](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bttkf9/terry_davis_was_right_all_along/) but it's a start. I still have dual boot for comparison and the machine runs noticeably better with linux than without. 

I'll also be installing <u>[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)</u> on my phone soon. I procrastinated this HARD since I got my most recent aluminum brick from marketplace, but it needs to be done.

Sadly, much like hating Apple products, this comes with an inevitable side effect of social castration to some degree. It's so bizarre to be surrounded by geniuses who use technology every day yet not care about things as fundamental as pricing or privacy, and instead like a boids simulation gravitate towards the cultural center of mass. All for convenience. I've pondered for hours over the justification for their decisions vs mine, but I conclude that the independence is worth the time investment.

Rom out.
