I had two midterms and three events this week. I am becoming a true fizzer.

### Thursday

In the morning I had my class 5 exam which I had booked months before. I got barely any sleep overnight but somehow passed by 1 point!

I then drove to school to catch a mech lecture and my group's lab, where we assembled some hydraulic circuits. I was convinced by the hydro prefix that the fluid would be water, but to my amusement and horror it was oil, and it went everywhere. Horror because I was dressed up for the job fair and any oil stain on my nice shirt would be generational aura debt. Thankfully I was spared from this embarrassment, and although I did end up getting another stain from food, it was hidden by the generously provided nametags.

At the fair I gave out resumes to every company that was taking them, but none of them really seemed like places I wanted to work at. As headstrong and eager as my cohort is to get hired somewhere, it seems most places just aren't taking summer coops yet.

The EUS was also giving out free food from Breka, and in a moment of weakness I caved in on my most fundamental principles and gorged on all their goodies. I despise the ubiquity of processed junk as a de facto requisite for social events but one time can't hurt. Also in my internet tourism I came across this bit of wisdom that changed my outlook on some things.

There is elegance in the simplicity of these tips. I've been implementing everything since encountering them and my interpersonal relationships have definitely improved a little.  

On the way to the bus loop I saw some raccoons in a tree. It wasn't even that late (7-8 pm) but the sun had set and the campus felt completely deserted, aside from these guys.

### Friday

Back when Engineers and Geoscientists BC gave me the entrance scholarship in first year I was very grateful and signed up for an account to establish myself as an engineer and geoscientist BC, and thought that was it. A few weeks ago I was proven wrong when an email from them came in inviting me to an event for scholarship winners. I accepted without a second thought.

The meeting was at Steamworks, where I had never been before. I entered with my friend and we were led in through a colossal labyrinth until we arrived at the big special doors at the big special room. 

Inside there was plenty of food, which I reluctantly accepted again, and beer, which I have no feud with. I met and spoke to the EGBC board of directors, including a very important guy in TransLink and a guy who had been on CanSat and was starting a space company, so my Orbit membership piqued his interest. This will be a crazy coop opportunity when it comes to fruition, but I need some more down-to-earth experience first. :)

Thanks to my friend for taking this photo. They had an official photographer dude take 100 photos of us from every angle but haven't publicized them yet.

### Saturday

I feel tremendously grateful to my lead on Orbit for agreeing to let me skip the meetings occasionally. The rain was torrential, and I needed sleep. 

Convincing myself that I had some free time I finally photographed and posted this frog I had folded weeks prior.

### Sunday

We (this time meaning mentors and mentees) went to laser tag! It was very fun, we had a teams game first and then an FFA. 

{{<image src="images/team.jpg" caption="A probability cloud of fizzers. I am yet to learn the official plural noun">}}

I played far too tactically, running and crouching more than necessary, and utterly exhausted myself (my quads still hurt). I wasn't the only one though, after the games we went outside and just cooled down for 30 minutes before going back in to our reserved room to feast again. I completely gave up on upholding any sort of boundaries and consumed far too much pizza.

In hindsight that was the first takeout pizza I've had in at least three years. Wow.

Since it was apparently some sort of ball appreciation day we also sang happy birthday to ball, even though it was not his birthday. I don't even remember what his username was here.

When our room booking had ended and everyone left, I drove some guys to the skytrain and then eventually got home, far too exhausted to complete my mech problems. I (almost) finished them the next evening.

Tonight was the first evening this week that I could write. This is a big one even without the usual addition of my stream of consciousness, but I pray no week will be this eventful again. See you later.
