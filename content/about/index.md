Hello! I'm Ron, a 3rd year engineering physics student at UBC. I like energy, space, and robotics.

My grandest ambitions are accessible space travel and universal nuclear power, while my more down-to-earth interests include biking, music, and origami. 

Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to check out my writing and projects!
