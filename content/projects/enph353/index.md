A virtual robot that detects targets and bypasses obstacles to compete in a race. 

Programmed in OpenCV and simulated in Gazebo.

I have implemented line following from a video feed using HSV thresholding, and imported it into ROS Gazebo to allow the robot to follow any terrain file.

Currently WIP.
